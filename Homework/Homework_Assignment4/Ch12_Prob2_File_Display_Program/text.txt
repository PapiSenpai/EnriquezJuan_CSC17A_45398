There are trees within the trees.
But thou be free,
how is it that you feel
light as you carry so much
peering heavy but no weight,
Out in the trees there are trees,
Trees where the eye can see
Climbing and falling,
Down to the ground,
Why?
Down the hole
where i ought to be,
Here I am
above all others,
Feeling of disparity
cold and lone.
