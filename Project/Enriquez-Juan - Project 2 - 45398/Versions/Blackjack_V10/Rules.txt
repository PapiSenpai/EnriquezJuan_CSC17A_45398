* BLACKJACK
* GAME RULES:
*   For the first round, each player has two cards each. Each player has the
*   choice to draw more cards if they would want to. The first person to reach
*   a score of 21 from their hand of cards wins instantly. An ace equals 11,
*   a king, queen, and jack all equal 10. If the player goes over the score of
*   21, then they have a busted hand. (If you have five cards, then that player 
*   wins)
